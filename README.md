Audacity to Reaper project converter
=====================================

This is an experimental converter which reads Audacity project files (`.aup`), and converts them to Reaper project files (`.rpp`). Audio data saved by Audacity (ProjectName_data containing `.au` files) is also included in this process, and gets converted to `.wav`.

It uses Python 3.6 and has no external dependencies.


Why
----

- I'm primarily doing this for fun, as I realized both softwares used fairly simple formats to store their data
- It might be useful for people wanting to switch to Reaper. Maybe.
